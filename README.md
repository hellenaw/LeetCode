# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Hi!! üëã
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository!

This project contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, specifically, the "Top Interview 150" problem set. 

It's organized into categories like on LeetCode for better navigation and understanding. 

I created this repository to:
	‚Ä¢	Expand my knowledge beyond classes and schoolwork üìö
	‚Ä¢	Track my problem-solving progress üìç
	‚Ä¢	Prepare for future interviews üë©‚Äçüíª

Feel free to take a look at the code and my problem solving skills.

## **Directory Structure**

- **`src/`**  
  Contains the source code for all LeetCode solutions, organized by categories:
  - `ArrayAndString/` - Solutions related to arrays and strings.
  
  - *More categories to be added as I progress!*

- **`bin/`**  
  Contains compiled `.class` files. This folder is excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`.

- **Folder-Specific READMEs**  
  Each category folder has a `README.md` file explaining the solutions and approaches used for problems in that category.

- **Big-O Cheatsheet**
  A PDF cheatsheet summarizing Big-O complexities is included in the src/ directory to reference common algorithmic complexities.
