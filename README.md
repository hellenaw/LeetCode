# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Hi!! welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository!
This project contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, specifically, the "Top Interview 150" problem set. 
It's organized into categories like on LeetCode for better navigation and understanding. 
I created this to expand my knowledge beyond classes and schoolwork, to help me track my progress, and prepare for future interviews at the same time.
Feel free to take a look at the code and gain insight into my problem solving skills.

## **Directory Structure**

- **`src/`**  
  Contains the source code for all LeetCode solutions, organized by categories:
  - `ArrayAndString/` - Solutions related to arrays and strings.
  
  - *More categories to be added as I progress!*

- **`bin/`**  
  Contains compiled `.class` files. This folder is excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`.
